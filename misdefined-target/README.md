## 🔍 Analysis Focus
In this lab, you will explore three key signals indicating a misdefined target:

1. **Drift Detection** 🌊  
   - Analyze changes in the target distribution over time.  
   - Reference Paper: [Detecting and Handling Concept Drift in Regression Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06316)  

2. **Granularity Check** 🔎  
   - Identify if the target variable has inappropriate levels or duplicates that reduce its informativeness.  
   - Reference Paper: [Granularity and Data Quality in Predictive Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500)  

3. **Noise Analysis** 🎯  
   - Detect anomalies or inconsistencies in the target variable due to measurement errors or label noise.  
   - Reference Paper: [A Survey of Noise in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00908)

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify misdefined targets in regression datasets.  
- Practice detecting drift, granularity issues, and noise.  
- Improve exploratory data analysis skills and understanding of data quality.  
- Reinforce critical thinking for real-world machine learning problems.
